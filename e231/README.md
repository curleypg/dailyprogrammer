This challenge was to create a cellular automata using "Rule 90" or a neighbor xor.

Each new line represents cellular growth or death depending on the neighboring cells above. If an individual cell is framed by unique cells on either side then it will grow (become x). If a cell is framed by identical cells then it will die (become blank " "). Each row spawns another either indefinitely or until all cells are dead. Some initial spawns have no irrational patters and some have predictable pattern (e.g. Serpinski triangles).
